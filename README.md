# SGHI FHIRðŸ”¥ Profile Implementation Guide

**SGHI FHIR Profile Implementation Guide** repository. This project is part of the **Lifesciences team** and aims to provide a robust framework for implementing FHIR profiles tailored to support healthcare data interoperability, specifically aligned with the needs of Savannah Informatics.

## Overview

The **SGHI FHIR Profile Implementation Guide** provides a comprehensive set of tools, resources, and documentation to aid developers, implementers, and healthcare organizations in adopting and utilizing FHIR standards. It includes customized FHIR profiles, value sets, and implementation details to streamline healthcare data exchange and improve interoperability.

## Key Features

- **Custom FHIR Profiles**: Tailored to SGHI use cases and requirements.
- **Implementation Guidance**: Detailed instructions for adoption.
- **Validation Tools**: Resources to validate compliance with SGHI FHIR profiles.
- **Example Resources**: Sample FHIR resources for quick reference and testing.

## Installation

This project requires the following dependencies:

- **SUSHI (FHIR Shorthand)**: For authoring and compiling FHIR profiles.
- **FHIR Validator CLI**
- **Node.js** (for validation tools)
- **Java 11 or later**

### Steps

1. Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install SUSHI globally by running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g fsh-sushi
   ```

## Usage

### Compiling FHIR Profiles

Use SUSHI to compile the FSH definitions into FHIR artifacts:
1. Download the latest version of the HL7 FHIR IG Publisher tool
```bash
./_updatePublisher.sh                  
```

2. Build the FHIR artifacts by running:
```bash
./cmd/run-sushi
```
3. Generate the FHIR IG(s)
```bash
./_genonce.sh                     
```

This will generate output in the following directory:
```bash
./fsh-generated
```
as well as the necessary FHIR artifacts in the `output` directory.
